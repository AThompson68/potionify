Once you download the zip file, as long as the "Assigment_2.pde" file is opened inside the "Assignment_2" folder, it should run with all of the images and sound effects located inside the folder.

To run the sound effects you will need to go into the menu in processing called "tools" and search for the "Sound" library and install it. Once it is installed it should make the code work for the sound effects that is installed in the project folder. 

It is a simple program and that is all that it requires to run. Enjoy!
